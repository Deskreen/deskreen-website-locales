Otherwise, if you really want it to work with a USB cable, you need to enable tethering between your computer and tablet in such a way so your computer shares the Internet with your tablet over USB. For example let’s say you have an IPad and Mac. You can connect them with USB cable and enable a built in feature of MacOS to do Internet sharing over USB to your IPad. Then you need to open a web browser on your IPad. Then type a slightly different address in the IPad web browser address bar than what you see under Deskreen QR code. For example if you see (your address will be different!) http//192.168.1.143131/123456 under QR code, on your IPad you will need to type http//192.168.2.13131/123456 . And then open the page. (Notice 192.168.2.1 - this only was tested and worked with IPads and Mac. Your case may be different) . Then Deskreen should run over USB in this case with no need for WiFi. At least it worked for some users. On Windows or Linux tethering devices over USB and sharing the Internet to them may be different. So you need to find your way on how to do this. Try google search to find out how to do this. This process may take you a lot of time and probably with no outcome, so we still highly recommend you to use Deskreen with WiFi or LAN.": "Yes.
